I don't think this scent screams for attention. If it turns heads or gets compliments I'd be surprised. It does have a blue collar kind of feel. I feel good just wearing a fragrance that has a name and price tag like this. It gives me a sense of power I guess. The birch part reminds me of the smells of a garage. The maleness of fixing a car while accumulating grease and oil over some aftershave. I do like this fragrance a lot, but I think its more the idea of having something expensive I like. I probably wouldn't buy it if it were 70 bucks"
